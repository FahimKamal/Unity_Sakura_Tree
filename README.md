# Unity Sakura Tree
Animated Sakura Tree created by following a Youtube tutorial. The size of tree, color of 
leaves and animations all can be modified as needed. 

# Toon Water Shader
I tried making a cartoonized water shader for day and night light. Which later I used 
for one of my games. Visit the play store here -> [Boat Blitz](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.novalabs.bb&pcampaignid=web_share).
